Your Project-redesign
============

This project template uses Eleventy to generate static HTML pages.

💡 Before starting to use this template, you should have completed the Eleventy tutorial.

### ← README.md

That's this file, which includes details about this project template.

### ← /src/

This is the directory where you will do all of your work, including your HTML and Sass.

### ← /src/sass/

This is where you will write the styles for your project. Note that it duplicates the structure used in the Eleventy tutorial.

### Adding media

To add images to your project, you must use the Glitch editor in the browser and drag your files into the `assets` container. You can then copy the URL for the asset and use it in your HTML or Sass. 👍🏻

### Project 4

Remember to review all the requirements for [Project 4](https://mica-web.github.io/gd-431/projects/project04/). While this template includes some of the necessary bits (like the homepage and 404), it does not create everything you need for a complete Project 4.
