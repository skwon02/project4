    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <p>"Morton Street Dance Center has played an important role in [my daughter's] life...thanks to Ms. Donna and her expert abilities to see the gift of dance in [my daughter] as soon as we walked through the door. Her warm and inviting spirit won us over, even before inquiring about the program. I can never thank all of the dance instructors enough for the level of care and discipline they instilled in her life through dance."
